Amazon Homepage Clone
This is a basic Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. The project helped me improve my understanding of webpage structuring and styling while practicing front-end development fundamentals. It was a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement!
